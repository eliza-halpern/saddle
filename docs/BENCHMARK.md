# Saddle benchmark gate (ARCHITECTURE.md §6 step 2)

Pre-registered before any comparison run. No moving goalposts: these tasks
and criteria are fixed; if the slice does not win decisively, stop.

## Reference tasks

All three are MECHANICAL (triage-router bypass of Phase 0). Each runs in a
fresh scratch repo with a committed baseline, through guided DAG emission →
Kahn scheduler → Tier-1-gated nodes → proof journal, and each produces a
human-readable transcript plus a verifying journal.

- **T1 — pure function plus test (tiny).** Baseline: empty repo with one
  stub module. Task: add an email-format validator plus pytest coverage.
  Expectation: 1–2 nodes, all gates pass first try.
- **T2 — bounded bug fix (small).** Baseline: a small module with a planted
  off-by-one in a retry loop plus a stale test. Task: fix the loop bound
  and repair the test. Expectation: red-phase flip is genuine (the stale
  test fails pre-change for the right reason).
- **T3 — two-file refactor (medium).** Baseline: duplicated validation
  logic across two modules with passing tests. Task: extract the shared
  helper into its own module, keep the suite green. Expectation: changed-
  line coverage holds across the moved lines; requirement binding names
  both touched requirements.

## Gate criteria

Each task runs on both the current pipeline and the Saddle slice:

1. **Wall-clock ≤ current** per task, measured from prompt to verified
   journal (or to the current pipeline's equivalent done signal).
2. **Correctness ≥ current**: Saddle output must pass its own Tier-1 gates
   and journal verification; a human judge then confirms the change does
   what the task asked. A gate-passing wrong answer fails this criterion.
3. **Zero malformed-packet retries**: guided emission (DAG plans and worker
   diffs) must parse first try — no tolerant re-parsing, no blind retries
   at the same temperature.
4. **Auditability**: every run leaves a verifying journal and a transcript
   a human can read end to end. A run without either fails regardless of
   speed or correctness.

## Decision rule

Proceed to phased migration (§6 step 3a) only on a decisive win across all
three tasks on criteria 1–4. Otherwise stop at step 2 and harvest (§6
step 3b): guided decoding, tool masking, and reasoning budgets port over
regardless.
